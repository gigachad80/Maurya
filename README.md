**Maurya: Virustotal Domain Analyzer for extracting sensitive info .**

ðŸ“Œ Overview


*_Maurya_*  is a security analysis tool in Python that interfaces with VirusTotal's API for domain reputation checking. It implements comprehensive error handling and JSON response parsing and created formatted output display for security analysis results including BitDefender findings and detected samples. In that JSON output you can get sensitive info like username , passwords etc..

### Why I Created This


You all know that bug hunters, especially those using CLI tools like Subfinder, Amass, Nuclei, Dirsearch, etc., face some challenges. Personally, Iâ€™ve been running into issues while bug hunting. I have to find the admin panel or subdomain for every domain using dorking, then set it up with the VirusTotal API. After that, I search for the URL like this: **https://[API_KEY].[domain or login panel]**, and then I have to sift through it using Ctrl + F to find any sensitive details.
This whole process is pretty lengthy, and I thought it would be way better if we could automate it with a CLI version. Thatâ€™s why I decided to create this tool
